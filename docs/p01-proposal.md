# Problem Domain

|Relevant Issues|Domain Impact|
|-----------------------------| -------------- |
|Maternity and the Pay Gap|  [Research by Jane Waldfogel](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.12.1.137) identifies a critical, yet stunningly neglected motivator in America's pay inequality: **_maternity policy_**. As Waldfogel's research explains, the quality of a country's parental leave policy has significant impacts on wage equality and parents' socio-econonomic mobility. Access to childcare allows parents to maintain a regular work schedule, build career experience, and keep a steady income. Compared to other industrialized countries, America's institutional structure has been extremely unsupportive of these policies despite extraordinary efforts to support equal pay. As shown in the figure below, the disconnect between equal pay efforts and ineffective structural support for parents has widespread and intersectional impacts on Americans. The wealth impacts on minoritized individuals is particularly stark. |
|Immagration and Wage Inequality| [This report](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ920372.pdf) examines how America's structural inequality impacts immigrants and their families. Because, _language_ barriers often create _learning_ barriers, immigrant children encounter challenges in school that have significant impacts on their oppurtunities long term. As the article points out, the journey to post-secondary education in America is riddled with challenges for the underprivileged. Becuase immigrant children pursuing post-secondary education are often the first in their family to do so, they are more likely to face financial barriers and lose out on informational resources than their peers. These barriers impact individuals early on, and their impacts carry on to their wealth outcomes and their childrens' wealth outcomes. |
| Race and Education: Unequal Oppurtunity | [This essay](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01419870.2017.1344267?needAccess=true) draws key insights about how race, education, and career opportunities intersect. Historical disadvantages remain entrenched in American society and challenge the idea that America has ever been a meritocracy. These disadvantages have complicated the availability of local quality public education, generational wealth, and representation in media for minoritized groups. Becuase these systematic inequalities interact with implicit bias, underprivileged individuals face incredible barriers when competing with their privileged peers. For one, elite colleges carry immense power in America, but acceptance is also highly elitist. Eligibility for these schools requires incredible resources that remain unequally available. In evaluating wealth outcomes, it is critical to consider how racial inequality plays a role not only in the hiring and salary outcomes, but also in the requisite steps. |
|Educational Oppurtunties and Pay|[This essay](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1925454?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents) explores the relationship between education and salary. Taking the inequality we have discussed into account, this article demonstrates how unequal access to education can have particularly devastating wealth impacts for marginalized groups. |
