 ## Abstract
 Our main question is related to the many components that impact the salary of individuals. This question is important because it examines the potential biases that they might be subjected to in a workplace environment that might hinder them from earning a salary of their colleagues. To address the question we have many categories that can hit multiple facets of the factors of salary and examine the impacts of these different variables.
 > **Keywords:** Salary, Age, Gender, Education Level, Intersectionality
 ## Introduction
 Salary is the recompense that people receive for their mental or physical effort, as well as the cost of living that supports an individual or a family, and it is meant to allow you to work for a long time. It also covers the expense of maintaining an individual or a family. Everyone needs a reliable source of income. There are, without a doubt, more factors that can have an effect on the income of each and every person. The following are some of the questions that will be investigated as part of our project, which has the overarching goal of determining the impact of a wide range of factors on several aspects of financial well-being: What effect does an individual's level of education have on their salary? What influence do gender disparities have on pay? What effect do different occupations have on salary? How does a person's country of origin influence the amount of salary they make? We will be utilizing a wide range of scholarly literature and data analysis in order to gain an in-depth comprehension of the myriad of factors that influence salary levels.







## Problem Domain

|Relevant Issues|Domain Impact|
|-----------------------------| -------------- |
|Maternity and the Pay Gap|  [Research by Jane Waldfogel](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.12.1.137) identifies a critical, yet stunningly neglected motivator in America's pay inequality: **_maternity policy_**. As Waldfogel's research explains, the quality of a country's parental leave policy has significant impacts on wage equality and parents' socio-econonomic mobility. Access to childcare allows parents to maintain a regular work schedule, build career experience, and keep a steady income. Compared to other industrialized countries, America's institutional structure has been extremely unsupportive of these policies despite extraordinary efforts to support equal pay. As shown in the figure below, the disconnect between equal pay efforts and ineffective structural support for parents has widespread and intersectional impacts on Americans. The wealth impacts on minoritized individuals is particularly stark. |
|Immagration and Wage Inequality| [This report](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ920372.pdf) examines how America's structural inequality impacts immigrants and their families. Because, _language_ barriers often create _learning_ barriers, immigrant children encounter challenges in school that have significant impacts on their oppurtunities long term. As the article points out, the journey to post-secondary education in America is riddled with challenges for the underprivileged. Becuase immigrant children pursuing post-secondary education are often the first in their family to do so, they are more likely to face financial barriers and lose out on informational resources than their peers. These barriers impact individuals early on, and their impacts carry on to their wealth outcomes and their childrens' wealth outcomes. |
| Race and Education: Unequal Oppurtunity | [This essay](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01419870.2017.1344267?needAccess=true) draws key insights about how race, education, and career opportunities intersect. Historical disadvantages remain entrenched in American society and challenge the idea that America has ever been a meritocracy. These disadvantages have complicated the availability of local quality public education, generational wealth, and representation in media for minoritized groups. Becuase these systematic inequalities interact with implicit bias, underprivileged individuals face incredible barriers when competing with their privileged peers. For one, elite colleges carry immense power in America, but acceptance is also highly elitist. Eligibility for these schools requires incredible resources that remain unequally available. In evaluating wealth outcomes, it is critical to consider how racial inequality plays a role not only in the hiring and salary outcomes, but also in the requisite steps. |
|Educational Oppurtunties and Pay|[This essay](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1925454?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents) explores the relationship between education and salary. Taking the inequality we have discussed into account, this article demonstrates how unequal access to education can have particularly devastating wealth impacts for marginalized groups. |

## Research Questions
1. **What effect does an individual's level of education have on their salary?**
It is important because sometimes people would argue that if the experiences would be  a more important factor on salary compared to the level of education, It would be the motivation for us to do this problem, we want to know if the level of education has an effect on salary.
2. **What influence do gender disparities have on pay?**
Gender inequality has been a huge topic in these years, the impact it has on many things, and we want to know that based on the data we selected, will there be a salary difference between males and females.
2. **How do different occupations have an effect on salary?**
There are lots of different occupations around the US,  and we are interested to find out the differences of salary among different occupations, and do certain type of occupations get more salary than others and if there is any relationship between salary and some occupations.
4. **How does a person's country of origin influence the amount of salary they make?**
We all know that US is a diverse country, there are lots of different people come from different backgrounds and countries, we are curious to find out do these factors effect the amount of salary those people get.
## Our Dataset

The data was extracted on May 1st, 1996 from the 1994 Census database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker with the means to determine whether a person makes over $50,000 per year. They worked with Silicon Graphics in Data Mining and Visualization to collect this data from the Census and contribute a table of the information. Overall, the data feels valid and credible because it came straight from a Census, which has a tract record of reliability. It should be noted that on the transfer there could have been some human errors and could translate to false information, though this is unlikely. Once collected, it was eventually made available on Kaggle, where it was donated and uploaded onto the site. It is important to remember that after upload to the open source website, this data can easily be used by an individual person or company that has malicious intent, like an insurance company who can then refuse to give loans to those with correlation with less than $50k a year income. Further, the dataset touches on many inequality intersectionalities, having many columns that cover many varying topics emphasizes them. Having a column for race, education, and salary in of itself allows for there to be opportunities to look at possible correlations and relationships between these categories. Our research questions mainly center around aspects of people that can influence the salary they earn. The table offers multiple different categories to dive into aspects of people that affect their overall pay. All of the possible categories include but are not limited to: age, working class, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, and sex. The goal of the research is to find correlations between a multitude of important aspects that make up a person when it comes to their salary. In this way, as many variables that make up a person will be analyzed, of course there will still be confounding variables that impact the possible salary an individual can make. These confounding variables include the environment of their upbringing, the location of their work, and, possibly the biggest one of them all, this data is from 1994. A lot has happened in the almost 30 year time span since the data was collected and might not reflect the society impacts of today, but it will give a fantastic look back from 30 years ago and be able to show us where we came from so that we can see where we're going next.

## Limitations
Just looking at the dataset, a few challenges come up with our dataset. The dataset contains salary and work details of mostly private employees from the United States. While there are more outliers in the work class, there are rarely any in the native country column. This type of data results in a general skew in the outcomes. Because of the lack of diversity, we are not able to find out much about people who don’t work private jobs, nor do we find out much about people who are not originally from the US.
Furthermore, there is no information of the hourly pay for all these people. While we have information on how many hours they work, there is no way to compute the hourly wage disparity possible
From the website, we find out that the data is from a 1994 Census database. This is extremely outdated and does not consider anything of the events in the last 28 years. This is another limitation of the dataset.

## Implications
In answering the different research questions as we have posed in the proposal, we find out a lot of implications that can be used for a lot of good. For example, we can use this data to compare the salaries of people based on their level of education. In today’s booming startup environment, with a lot of bright minds dropping out of college, this knowledge can help us address whether a college degree is still desirable or not.
Furthermore, this data allows us to compare the occupation of a person to their salary. This can be aspirational to some people who are considering doing a sort of job but are still on the fence. Shows us how much in demand a specific field of job is in. Lastly, but very importantly, this data can allow us to compare salary to the gender of the person. Evaluating this data will allow us to raise awareness and address the already-known controversy regarding gender pay disparity. Using this data, we can ask for more equality in this matter.
